           <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
       </p> 
       <ul>
           <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
           <li><strong>1933</strong> -  Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br>Administration"</li>
           <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
           <li><strong>1937</strong> -  Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
           <li><strong>1938</strong> -  Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to <br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br>study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent <br>plants.</li>
           <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,<br> DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and other applied science.</li>
           <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
           <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br>
                                       pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology<br>
                                       program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains<br>
                                      of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major<br> climate on Earth.</li>
           <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling <br>wheat yields</li>

           <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>
                                       American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes
                                       <br> to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the 
                                      <br>Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a 
                                      <br>rapidly expanding population </li>
                                
            <li><strong>1970</strong> receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize <br>
                                     and sorghum yields</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." 
                                        <br>Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the 
                                        <br>demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not 
                                        <br>inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants 
                                        <br>and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people </li>
           <li><strong>2005</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
                       
       
        </ul>
